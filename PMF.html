							<sup>Figure: Children utilize the Play with Morphing Food toolkit (1), which includes a food library, trigger tools (exemplified by the use of wafer paper (2)), and instruction cards. They adeptly create personalized morphing dishes (3 and 4) and derive enjoyment from tasting their creations (5).</sup>

							<h3 class="major">Abstract</h3>
							<p>To support children’s food interaction and enhance their understanding of food through morphing food technology, we develop a design exploration through the Research through Design (RtD) methodology. Our exploration integrates four stages: (1) defining design objectives through empathy with stakeholders, (2) investigating morphing food materials to understand their deformation mechanisms, (3) designing and iteratively developing tools based on user feedback, and (4) conducting a workshop-based evaluation. Our design outcome is a toolkit, comprising a morphing food library, trigger tools, and instructional interfaces. The workshop showed that through interaction with morphing food, children learned not only scientific principles but also developed culinary skills, as well as the diversity of food forms and functions. We discussed the detailed findings, insights, and implications for future design.</p>

							<blockquote>
								<p>
								This project was built on the foundations of <a href="EdibleToy.html">EdibleToy</a>, where my team and I explored the potential of edible thin films as interactive materials for children. In this follow-up work, we expanded our experimentation to a wider range of edible materials and developed a comprehensive toolkit for children.
								</p>
								<p>
								As the project lead, I was responsible for managing the overall research while staying deeply involved in material testing, user research, and other hands-on aspects of the study. I also took the lead in writing the long-form paper documenting our findings. Since this was my first time authoring such a comprehensive manuscript, I acknowledge there are areas for improvement, and I sincerely welcome feedback and guidance from colleagues in the field.
								</p>
